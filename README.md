# Sequencing Protocol
## Experimental Design and Documentation
Click the link attached below. It will lead to a google form, in which it will ask for the following:
1) The current date, time started, and name.
2) What is your research question for this sequencing run? (This includes oligo pool if running OligoHyb and other general run info)
3) Special notes (ie. changes in reagents, concentrations, etc.)
5) Which sequencer will be used?

## Sequencing Machine Settings
Once 'Start Sequencing' has been selected on the MinKNOW device, you will be met with a screen like this. Fill out the 'Experiment Name' section in the format: YYMMDD-EXPERIMENTNAME-MEMBERNAME. Where experiment name is the type of protocol followed (ie. cfDNAOligoHyb, Whole Genome, or GenomicOligoHyb) and MEMBERNAME is your name. SampleID will always be 1.

Once you have filled out those sections, you will select the 'Load settings from template' button to select the correct run settings. Click the template name that matches your EXPERIMENTNAME that you chose in the previous step.

### This section is to be followed only if a template is not available
If a template cannot be found that matches your EXPERIMENTNAME, these settings are generally acceptable for our lab; however, please contact Ethan McQuhae or Jordan Moore before beginning the run to verify.

## Uploading Data and Documentation
The Google Forms will automatically be uploaded. However, send Dr. Jonathon Hill an email containing a link to the sequencing raw data in Box so that he can upload it to the server.
