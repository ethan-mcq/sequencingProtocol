# sequencingProtocol
nanopore sequencing protocol

## 1. Experimental Design
Create a document to take notes throughout the protocol. Remember to add the current date, time started, and name.
Questions to answer in a seperate document:
1) What is our research question for this sequencing run?
2) What steps/portions of the OligoHyb protocol will be completed? Are there any changes in reagents, concentrations, etc.?
3) What oligopool is being run, if relevant?
4) Which sequencer will be used? How long did the run last?

## 2. 

## 3. Create Sub-Folder and upload documents into R&D Shared-Drive
1) Find the project relevant to the sequencing run (i.e. WGS).
2) Under the project folder, create a sub-folder titled as so:
     YY/MM/DD;PROJECT;NAME
3) Upload the document that contains the experimental design and any notes taken throughout the run.
