nanopore sequencing protocol

## 1. Experimental Design and Documentation
Click the link attached below. It will lead to a google form, in which it will ask for the following:
1) The current date, time started, and name.
2) What is your research question for this sequencing run?
3) What steps/portions of the OligoHyb protocol will be completed? Are there any changes in reagents, concentrations, etc.?
4) What oligopool is being run (if you proceed with hybridization)?
5) Which sequencer will be used? How long did the run last?

## 2. Sequencing Procedure

## 3. Uploading Data and Documentation
The Google Forms will automatically be uploaded. However, send Dr. Jonathon Hill an email containing a link to the sequencing raw data in Box so that he can upload it to the server.
